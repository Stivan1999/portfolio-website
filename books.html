        <h3>
          I am halfway through this book at the time of writing this
          (10/8/2023). As I moved into a new apartment this fall, I picked this
          book while grocery shopping at Meijir. I instantly fell in love with
          it. It talks about a mother who witnesses her son committing a murder
          on an autumn day after midnight. After that, the mother starts waking
          up backward every morning and tries to find the clue to why her son
          would do what he did on that night. Thriller, Suspense, Mystery, and
          sudden plot twists are my perfect types in a story. If you try this
          book, do not forget to red it while eating warm cinnamon rolls and
          sipping on a cup of tea ðŸ˜‰.

        <h3>
          A book about the multiverse theory? Yes please, this type of story is
          my cup of tea. Nora decides to end her life around midnight because
          her life is miserable (or at least she thinks so). She then finds
          herself at this place called the midnight library. Every book in this
          library is a different version of herself that made different choices
          in life. She gets to discover the alternate lives she could have led.
          Will she find the ultimate universe where she is happy and her life is
          not a ruin? This book really made think about my life and the choices
          I made, make, and keep making. What would have happened if I decided
          to go to a different school? If I have said no to the first job offer
          I got? decided not to leave my country, friends, and family to come to
          the US and pursue my goals? This book is an absolute eye-opener and
          will leave you thinking for days.

          A knock on the door, Hannah opens it and receives a note from a
          stranger. The note only contains The words "Protect her". and
          suddenly, Hannah's husband disappears. I know right!! What a mystery.
          It is so hard to say anything about this book without spoiling. So I
          will leave it at this, if you love mystery like I do then you will
          absolutely love this book.
