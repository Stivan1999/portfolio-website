# portfolio-website

Creating a portfolio website for myself using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and python framework flask for the back end tasks.

The structure/road map I will be following is as follows:

BUILD THE FRONTEND (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPTS)

1. Create the Home/Landing page

   - Navigation Bar/Menu

     - Work item #1: Create the skeleton for the navigation bar in HTMLW
     - Work item #2: Style the navigation bar in style.css
     - Work item #3 part #1: Make the navigation bar responsive
       Work item #3 part #2: Add a menu and exit buttons to get in and out of the side responsive navigation bar.

   - Work item #4: cretae the rest of the Home/Landing page (text, image)

2. Create "contact me" page

   - Add HTML code
   - Style the page
   - Make the page responsive.

3. Create "About me" page

   - Add HTML code
   - Style the page
   - Make the page responsive

4. Create "blog" page

   1. page to talk about books I read.
   2. page to talk about experiences and travel in 2023.
   3. a placeholder page for additional information later.

5. Add "projects" page


THE BACKEND
1) create a templates folder and move all html
   files into it.
2) move CSS and JS files into static folder
3) Create a python script with simple flask server
4) Store information from form in contact-me page.

IMPORTANT NOTE for myself and anyone reading this: I am by no mean a web developer or have had experience with that (at least up until I finish this project) so this will be kind of messy. I am also not planning on becoming a web developer but wanted to know/learn how websites are styled and structured from scratch.

My main GOAL is to create a one-stop portfolio website by the end of this year (2023) and learn new things,know how websites are created from scratch, and have fun as much as possible along the way.
With that being said, I am going to follow two sources to accomplish my goal:

1. https://www.codingnepalweb.com/ is a websote that I found while doing some reserach on resources. I will be following a video of how
   they implement things and code along.
2. I am a student at https://academy.zerotomastery.io/ enrolled in the python course. I will be following the flask section of that course
   to learn how to set up falsk for my portfolio webiste.
