# portfolio-website

Creating a portfolio website for myself using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and python framework flask for the back end tasks.

The structure/road map I will be following is as follows:

1. Create the Home/Landing page
2. organize project structure for Flask and start learning how to use it.
3. Create another page (About me)
4. Verify that I can navigate between the pages using flask
5. TBD
6. TBD
7. TBD

IMPORTANT NOTE for myself and anyone reading this: I am by no mean a web developer or have had experience with taht. I am also not planning on becoming a web developer.
My main GOAL is to create a one-stop portfolio website by the end of this year (2023) and learn new things/have fun as much as possible along the way.
With that being said, I am going to follow two sources to accomplish my goal

1. https://www.codingnepalweb.com/ is a websote that I found while doing some reserach on resources. I will be following a video of how
   they implement things and code along.
2. I am a student at https://academy.zerotomastery.io/ enrolled in the python course. I will be following the flask section of that course
   to learn how to set up falsk for my portfolio webiste.
