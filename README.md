# portfolio-website
Creating a portfolio website for myself using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and python framework flask for the back end tasks. 

IMPORTANT NOTE for myself and anyone reading this: I am by no mean a web developer or have had experience with taht. I am also not planning on becoming a web developer.
My main GOAL is to create a one-stop portfolio website by the end of this year (2023) and learn new things/have fun as much as possible along the way.
With that being said, I am going to follow two sources to accomplish my goal
1) https://www.codingnepalweb.com/ is a websote that I found while doing some reserach on resources. I will be following a video of how
   they implement things and code along.
2) I am a student at https://academy.zerotomastery.io/ enrolled in the python course. I will be following the flask section of that course
   to learn how to set up falsk for my portfolio webiste.
